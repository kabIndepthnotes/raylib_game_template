# prerequistes
- for windows compiling you need a cross-compiler such as gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
- for web builds you will need to compile raylib to work with web. To do this you need emscripten.
- you need a regular raylib.h headerfile compiled for everything else.
- I follow the literate programming style, and use https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate . This is not necessary and you simply have to change the MAKEFILE accordingly.

# windows cross compile
- The steps are similar to compiling raylib for linux, but you must supply some flags
`make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc PLATFORM_OS=WINDOWS`

# web compiling
- as of Thursday 6 Mar 2025 the commandline compilation of the web build ( https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-for-Web-(HTML5)#21-command-line-compilation ) does not work, I recommend using the command below
- `make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB # To make web version.`
